Hello Nimish,
 
Would like to thank Atul for having the initial overview of the key topics covered in the KT sessions. It would be good if we get a chance to delve into the details in the coming days.
Considering our day-to-day tasks in the project, it would be immensely helpful if he could shed light on the practical aspects. 
Understanding how to handle tasks such as tickets and providing insights into the workflow would be greatly beneficial for all of us.
 
Looking forward to gaining more in-depth knowledge in the upcoming sessions.
 
Thanks & regards,
Anand Patil
